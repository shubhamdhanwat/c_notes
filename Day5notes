Function

    if any variable is declared and not assigned value
        every variable is deaclared as auto and
    it has a automaatic sotrage calss
        which given then garbage value;
stack cleaning

as soon as the function return the stack is cleaned
and if the function is called again then again the stack is filled according to the function variables.

global variavle is not stored in stack it is stored in data section 
it is safe in data section untill main is not end
extern int i
here i is the variable decalred after/before the end of main function in main.c file

extern is applied only for global variable
-------------------------------
int z// global

main ()
{
    int m = 100 // local
        extern int k
            k = 20;
}
int k;

factorial()
{

    int i extern int z;
    for (1......z)
}
first preprocessor works then compiler


Pre processor
#starting with hash
pre processor directary

1) Macro
#define SIZE 20
macro text replacement
